        "text": "**Possession**: To show that something possesses something else, you use *-h(o)* on the possessor. For example, \"My daughter's dog\" would be rendered as *My dog daughter-h(o)* (or in full Tsevhu, *tso kiim zisih*). Another form of *-h(o)* is the word *phoi*, placed after the possessor, so our example could also be *My dog daughter phoi* (or *tso kiim zisi phoi*). These two forms are interchangeable.\n**Composition**: To say that something is made of something (ex \"house of cards\"), you use the suffix *-yp* on the second one (\"cards\"). So for \"house of cards\" (or more precisely \"house made of cards\"), you'd say *house cards-yp* (or *naec tiimnyp* in Tsevhu).\n**Filled with**: The suffix *-ype* is used to show that something is filled with something else. For example, to say \"hovercraft full of eels\", you'd say *hovercraft eels-ype* (or *twnkhov tvype*).\n**Part of**: To say that something is part of some larger thing, the *-yl* suffix (*-ylu* for plural) is placed on the possessee. So to say \"Fish of a herd of cats\", you would say *fish-yl cat-yt* (or *wteyl xujyt*).\n**Topic**: In the phrase *I'm dreaming of you*, the *of* represents the topic that the speaker is dreaming about. For this, you would use *-i'a* on *you*."
